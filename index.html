        <h2>Hi! I'm Oliver Magrane</h2>

            Hi! I'm Oliver. I was born in Venezuela, yet I grew up in San Francisco. After graduating from college as a
            music major I moved back to Venezuela to get in touch with my roots and to practice my Spanish. I traveled
            around South America for a couple of months and then ended up living in Venezuela for almost five years. I
            played in a big band, taught music lessons, and also worked in the microbrewing industry. Eventually, I
            moved back to the States and worked in customer service at a small high end bicycle store.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve always wanted to work in a science/engineering-related field
            and thought how exciting it would be to make my own websites and
            applications! I decided to enroll in a software engineering program
            and it has been one of the most transformative experiences of my
            life. As grueling and difficult as the journey has been, I’m
            grateful for what I have accomplished and I have fallen in love
            with programming and developing applications. I’m geared up to
            continue growing my programming skills and immersing myself in the
            developer community. It’s so exciting to be starting a new career in
            technology as a software developer!
