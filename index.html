            <h2>Hi! I'm Oliver Magrane</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>
                Hi! I'm Oliver. I was born in Venezuela, yet I grew up in San Francisco. After graduating from college
                as a
                music major I moved back to Venezuela to get in touch with my roots and to practice my Spanish. I
                traveled
                around South America for a couple of months and then ended up living in Venezuela for almost five years.
                I
                played in a big band, taught music lessons, and also worked in the microbrewing industry. Eventually, I
                moved back to the States and worked in customer service at a small high end bicycle store.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve always wanted to work in a science/engineering-related field
                and thought how exciting it would be to make my own websites and
                applications! I decided to enroll in a software engineering program
                and it has been one of the most transformative experiences of my
                life. As grueling and difficult as the journey has been, I’m
                grateful for what I have accomplished and I have fallen in love
                with programming and developing applications. I’m geared up to
                continue growing my programming skills and immersing myself in the
                developer community. It’s so exciting to be starting a new career in
                technology as a software developer!
            </p>

                <p>Completing the Thinkful program I’ve developed and deployed
                    mobile-first applications while learning new languages and
                    frameworks, spending several hours per week collaborating
                    with and learning from senior web developers in a mentor-student
                    relationship. My specialties are web design/full-stack web
                    development. I have learned industry best practices and software
                    development standards with a focus on Javascript, HTML5, CSS3,
                    ReactJS, ExpressJS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs, algorithms
                    and data structures.
